# Course Files

This repo has my practice app files for the [Udemy Vue 2 Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/vue-2-crash-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/9374922?start=0).

## vue_cdn
This directory has a single html file that contains a link to the Vue cdn and as simple Vue script. It is the most simple, basic "Hello World" implementation of a Vue app. I've noticed that when using the CDN, Google Chrome does not recognize the CDN Vue in order to activate the extension.
