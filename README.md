# Course Apps

This repo has my practice app files for the [Udemy Vue 2 Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/vue-2-crash-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/9374922?start=0).

## vue_cdn
This directory has a single html file that contains a link to the Vue cdn and as simple Vue script. It is the most simple, basic "Hello World" implementation of a Vue app. I've noticed that when using the CDN, Google Chrome does not recognize the CDN Vue in order to activate the extension.

## vue_cli_app
This app has a few different components and takes advantage of the "template", "logic", "style" model. Features:

* validation via [VeeValidate](https://baianat.github.io/vee-validate/)
* animations [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
* forms
* pages with routes
* add/remove items from list dynamically
* lists do not persist in any sort of caching or db
